Money Laundering Detection using PaySim

End-to-End Data Engineering & ML Pipeline | Spark • DBT • ML • Power BI

This project implements a complete data engineering and machine learning pipeline to detect potential money laundering activities using the PaySim synthetic financial transaction dataset. It showcases modern data engineering practices including ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering, ML model training, DBT modeling, Spark transformations, and a Power BI dashboard for business insights.

🏗️ Pipeline Overview
1. Data Ingestion

Loads raw PaySim dataset into the pipeline
Environment variables managed using .env

2. Data Cleaning (Spark)

Converts raw transaction logs into optimized parquet format
Handles schema standardization and data quality checks

3. Feature Engineering

Creates AML-focused behavioral features
Identifies abnormal patterns such as high-value transfers and rapid repeated transactions

4. Machine Learning Model

Trains a Random Forest classifier to detect suspicious transactions
Saves trained model for downstream scoring

5. Transaction Scoring

Scores all transactions to assign risk levels
Outputs suspicious activity for analytics

6. DBT Transformation Layer

Builds staging and mart models
Produces analytical datasets for reporting

7. Power BI Dashboard

Interactive AML dashboard that includes:
Suspicious transactions
High-risk customers
Daily & category-wise risk trends
Aggregated AML insights
